A web application for predicting the likelihood of purchasing travel insurance using machine learning.

Project description:
This project aims to solve a classification problem: predicting whether a customer will purchase an insurance policy. The tool is designed for the marketing and sales departments of insurance companies to prioritize “hot” customers and optimize their marketing budget.

Technology stack:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
- Joblib (Model serialization)
- treamlit (Interactive web interface)
- FastAPI (Optional, as a backend service)

Modeling results:
The model was trained on data from 2,000 customers. 
Algorithm - Gradient Boosting 
Accuracy ~84.17%
Key features:
1. `AnnualIncome` (Annual income)
2. `EverTravelledAbroad` (Experience traveling abroad)
3. `Age` (Age)
